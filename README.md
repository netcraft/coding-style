=======================
Based on this Codepen:

Basically it's just a code example which plays a silly game with itself,
with the sole purpose of showcasing different aspects of our coding standards.

Open the relevant files to see the code (HAML / SCSS / JS).
NOTE: the code won't run locally, you should see the Codepen for the example to work.
